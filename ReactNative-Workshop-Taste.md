> To run your application on your phone, go to the app store - and install `Expo Client`. (Alternatively, you can run your apps from `Expo Snack` on your laptop!)

## Instructions:
This will be the starting point - 
1. Open this [Expo Snack](https://snack.expo.io/@julianbroudy/a-taste-of-react-native) - Starting with a simple empty template/project, ready to be manipulated.
    - You might need to sign up/log in in order to save your work.
1. Add a **Button** component that takes you from `screen1` to `screen2`.
    - Check out [Button Documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/handling-touches) by React Native.
1. Add a List of your family members/friends names on `screen2`.
    - You can use the following components: [FlatList](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist), [ListView](https://reactnative.dev/docs/using-a-listview), [ListItem](https://reactnativeelements.com/docs/listitem/)..etc.
1. Make each element (family member/friends names) **pressable** 
    - When pressed - show an alert. (Hint: Find out how to create alerts [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/alert))
