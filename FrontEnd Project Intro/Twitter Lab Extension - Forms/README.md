> Before we start, make sure to go back to your code from the **databases lab**! If you haven't finished it yet, you must complete it before moving on to here.


## Instructions:

1. If you haven't transformed `main.py` to a Flask app, this is a good time to do that.

2. Create a new route, called `signup`, it should go create a new account after taking these attributes in a form:
    - Full Name
    - Username
    - Password
    - Email
    - Bio
    - ** Make sure to also add a `password` *column* in `model.py`.
    - *** If you got an error after adding `password` to `model.py` -> Solve this by deleting the `database.db` file, and running your app again.

3. Create a new route, called `login`, it should go to the twitter homepage if the login info are correct! 
     - It should look something like this:

4. Now, after you're done with setting up the `login` and `signup` features, let's add a **Twitter Post** feature!
    - In your twitter homepage, add a form that takes:
        1. Tweet text - Should be a maximum of 280 characters.
        2. Image link - Optional
