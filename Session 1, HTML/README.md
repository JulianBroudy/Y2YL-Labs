# Y1 Yearlong 2020-2021 - Session 1, HTML Lab

## Objective:
During this lab, you will be creating a small **Online Shop**!  
You will be using purely HTML as a coding language for this lab,
it should help familiarize you with Frontend, HTML Tags & Attributes.

Do not be afraid of using the Internet to find out more about HTML

**First things first, create a new Repl.it account if you haven't already! Here are [instructions](https://github.com/meet-projects/Y2-Seminar2020-Labs/blob/master/replit-setup.md) to help you set up!**
**Open a new Repl, select `HTML, CSS, JS` as the Language, call it `HTML Lab1`, and write/upload your final code there :D**

## Instructions:
You will need two HTML pages in this website, `index.html` & `about.html`.  
The **Indix page** is already there, so let us create the **About page**.<br/>  
1. Click on **`Add file`** then name it `about.html`.  
Then copy the code structure from `index.html` and paste it into `about.html`.<br/><br/>
2. Create a simple **navigation tool** by using the **`<a>`** tag (as represented in the example below), this allows us to jump from the **Home page** to the **About page**. Now do the same thing to get from the **About page** to the **Home page**.

3. Use the **`<h1>`** tag to create a header to your pages.<br/><br/>
4. Now add the products of your liking to your store using the **`<h2/3/4..>`** tags to give them a name and write a short description about them.<br/><br/>
5. The next step is adding an image for the products (by using an **`<img>`** tag) that when clicked on it will lead you to the product's page on Amazon, eBay, etc...(by using an **`<a>`** tag).  
`*Note: Make sure that your images are saved in the same folder as your code.`<br/><br/>
6. For the final step, add a short description of your online shop in the **About page**.<br/><br/><br/>

## Bonus:
Get your imagination going and think of even more creative ways to improve your website!  
Few Suggestions: Separate pages for different products, A Navigation Bar and much more!!!<br/><br/>
**Good luck & Do your best!  
Remember to show your wonderful work to your partners and instructors so we can learn from each other.**<br/><br/>

## HTML Section
1. Editing `index.html`.<br/> 
2. Make your page stand out!<br/> To do that change it to be about a topic that you're interested in,<br/> your page should have the following (doesn't have to be in order):<br/>
> - Add/change the title of your page  
> - A body tag   
> - A paragraph inside the body  
> - An h1 tag inside the body  
> - An h2 tag inside the body.<br/><br/>


3. Add an image.<br/> In the same `index.html` file, add an image related to the topic you wrote about. **Set the width to 400px**.<br/><br/>
4. Add a link.<br/>
Add a link to the Wikipedia page about the animal or the topic you're interested in.
<br/><br/>

## CSS Section

1. Use the Tag selector to change the background of your HTML page to your favorite color.<br/>
2. Use an ID selector to set a CSS property of one element on your page.<br/>
A property could be: font-size, border, color, etc...<br/>

3. Use a class selector to set a CSS property of one element on your page.<br/>
 
<br/>

## Javascript Section 

1. Make sure that `script.js` is linked to **`index.html`**.
2. In **`script.js`**, define a new *function* called `changeBackgroundColor`, that takes 1 argument -> `color`
    - The function should change the background color of "hello.html" to "color".
3. Add a "button" tag in **`index.html`** with a text that says "Change BG Color".
    - The button has to have an `onclick` attribute, linked to the `changeBackgroundColor(color)` function.
    - Fill in the `color` argument whatever you like!
4. Test out your button!
    - Try it with different `color` values.

## OOP Section
In this section, you are an engineer at Youtube!  
Susan, the CEO of Youtube, asks you to create an easier way to access, modify, and create youtube videos.  
You have an idea! Why not use OOP? it's going to be super easy to do all of the requirements using Object Oriented Programming.

1. Create a new Python file, called **`oopReview.py`**.
2. In `oopReview.py`, create a new Class called `YoutubeVideo`.
    - It should take 4 attributes:
    - `title` - The title/name of the video.
    - `description` - The description of the video/Short explanation about the video.
    - `likes` - Number of likes, should start equal to 0.
    - `dislikes` - Number of dislikes, should start also equal to 0.
    - `comments` - A dictionary of comments, where the "username" is the **key**, and the comment text is the **value**. Should start empty.

3. Define a new function in `YoutubeVideo` and call it `like`. The function should add 1 like to `likes`.

4. Define a similar function, call it `dislike`. The function should add 1 dislike to `dislikes`.

5. Define a new function, call it `add_comment`. The function should take 2 attributes:
    1. `username` - The username of the commenter.
    2. `comment_text` - The actual comment!
    - The function should add "username" as a **key** to "comments" dictionary, and "comment_text" as the **value**.

6. Define a new function, call it `print_info`.
    - Make it so the function prints all of the video's information, in a similar way to this:
    <img src="https://github.com/meet-projects/Y2-Summer-Labs/blob/master/1.1%20Day%201%2C%20Morning%2C%20Intro%20to%20Summer/YoutubeVideoExample-OOP.png">


7. Create a new youtube video **object**, and fill in the attributes!
    - Test out all of the object's functions.
    - How would you add 495 likes?
    - Show your partner/family members!


##### Great job on completing your first Lab!
##### Call an Instructor/TA to check your completed tasks
 

If you have extra time, continue to the **Bonus Problems** *below*.

## Bonus Problems: 
If you have finished and still have time, first of all **GOOD JOB!** 

1. Costumize the `changeBackgroundColor` function in **`main.js`** to change switch between 2 colors, instead of switching to 1 specific color.
    - For example:
        1. The background is Blue.
        2. On 1st button click, the background will change to Yellow.
        3. On 2nd button click, the background will change to Blue.
        4. And so on... (Keeps switching between Yellow and Blue on every new click!)

2. Let's make a recommended videos algorithm!!
    - Firstly, add an attribute to **`YoutubeVideo`** class, call it `hashtag`. It should be a **list up to 5 words** that describe the video.
    - Come up with a function called `recommended_videos`, the function should return the videos with similar hashtags!
