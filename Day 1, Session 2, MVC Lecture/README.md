## Instructions:

1. Pair up with a partner, and draw the layout of an **MVC Map**!
    - It can be done using a paper and pen.  

</br>  

2. After drawing the **MVC Map**, add description of each box/station/map point.
    - For example: Controller -> Controls the application, updates views...etc.  
</br>  

3. Draw the restaurant example experience using an MVC map!  

##### Great job!
##### Call an Instructor/TA to check your completed tasks
